# GifGetter

This app allows the user to pull gifs from the Giphy API.

The app works by adding a form to the page which takes the value from the user input box and adds it to the topics array. Then, a function call takes in each topic in the array to create buttons in the HTML on the page.

When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs static, non-animated gif images from the Giphy API and places them on the page. 

When the user clicks one of the still Giphy images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing.

Above every gif, its rating is displayed (pg, g, etc.)
